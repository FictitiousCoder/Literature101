# Literature101
A dynamic website which aims to educate people on literary devices, punctuation and their uses in literature, and give a quick review of certain classics from literature.

What content is on the website is entirely up to the users, and the site will be mostly void of content until you actually start adding content. Everyone can register an account, but only people with editing rights may add/edit/remove content. The rights to edit would be given by someone with admin-access to the database.

Note that you'd need to connect the site to a database andadd some dummy-data to test it in any meaningful way.
